# Image-Stegnograpghy
This project demonstrates a steganography system that conceals hidden messages within digital images using LSB (Least Significant Bit) insertion techniques. It involves embedding and extracting messages from image data with minimal impact on visual quality. The system also incorporates encryption for message security, ensuring that only intended recipients with the decryption key can retrieve the hidden content. This implementation provides insights into data hiding techniques and image processing, emphasizing both technical and practical aspects of secure communication.
